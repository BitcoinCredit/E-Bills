        <h2 id="main_info">   A fundamental missing element for a Bitcoin-based financial system and economy is a method to
            facilitate payment by issuing instruments repayable at a later date. An electronic version of the
            international framework for
            bills of exchange provides the core of the solution. We propose a peer-to-peer network that records all
            credited
            bitcoin amounts payable to, or receivable by, encrypted and hashed identities in a blockchain. The proposed
            new system provides privacy protection on a need to know basis. Bitcredit is operational even if and when
            central banks and commercial banks fail in a monetary crisis. The build-up of issued bitcoin will create a
            credit
            superstructure M1 on top of mined bitcoin M0 which will stabilize bitcoinâ€™s value. Bitcoin will ascend to
            become a unit of account.</h2>
